Welcome to the text-based Black Jack Game:

This is an OOP based BlackJack code written by ehsan Kabiri Rahani. The writer has tried to encapsulate the code to make it easier to follow.

1-The rules of the game follow the Casino's version in which one of the dealer's cards are 'Face Down'(Hidden) untill when the player stands.
and the hidden card will be revealed when the dealer hits.
2-This version allows splitting only once, therefore the splitted hands may not be splittable again.
3-We have only hand1 when the player does not split and hand2 will come into play when splitting takes place.
